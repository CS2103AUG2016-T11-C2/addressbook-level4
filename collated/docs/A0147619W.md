## Introduction

Welcome to the ForgetMeNot development team!

ForgetMeNot is a task manager application that keeps track of your tasks, events and
deadlines. It allows you to manage them efficiently with a keyboard-oriented
command line interface.

This development guide aims to quickly familiarise you with the ForgetMeNot
code base. It will give you an overview of the code architecture, as well as
its various components and how they all interact with each other. By the end of this document, you will
be ready to make your first awesome change to the code. The guide is organized from a top-down perspective to allow an overall idea to be grasped before moving on to the specifics. 


Ready to dive in? Let's get started!

```
###### /DeveloperGuide.md
``` md
For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<img src="images/LogicDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`. This same _Sequence Diagram_ will be used to illustrate `undo` in the following _Sequence Diagram_.

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800"><br>

>Note how the method saveToHistory() is called when delete is being executed. A copy of the `TaskManager` will be stored
within `Model`. This is the same for task modifying commands such as `add`, `edit` and `clear`.

```
###### /DeveloperGuide.md
``` md

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/forgetmenot/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>
<img src="images/DeleteTaskSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/forgetmenot/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores ForgetMeNot's data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

#### Adding a Task: `add`
Adds a task to the task manager<br>
Time Format: 12-hour clock(Eg: 10am, 5:30pm, etc).
 
* If you want to use keywords such as `at`, `from`, `to` and `by` in the task name in isolation, it should be preceded by a `\\`.             
* If no particular time is mentioned, ForgetMeNot adds a task at the current time.
* If the user tries to add a task which is clashing with any other task, ForgetMeNot displays a warning message.

* `add Homework at 2pm` 

	This add a task to 2pm of the current day
	
* `add project meeting at 21/11/16`

	This gives it the current time when you add the task
	
* `add tutorial at `7pm 12/12/16`
* `add buy gift at 3 days later`
* `add buy presents at christmas`

##### Adding a deadline task
Adds a task with only the end time <br>
