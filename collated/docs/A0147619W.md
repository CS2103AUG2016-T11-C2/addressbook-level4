#### Adding a Task: `add`
Adds a task to the task manager<br>
Time Format: 12-hour clock(Eg: 10am, 5:30pm, etc).
 
* If you want to use keywords such as `at`, `from`, `to` and `by` in the task name in isolation, it should be preceded by a `\\`.             
* If no particular time is mentioned, ForgetMeNot adds a task at the current time.
* If the user tries to add a task which is clashing with any other task, ForgetMeNot displays a warning message.

##### Adding a floating task
Adds a task without any start time or end time <br>
Format : `add <task name>`<br>

Examples:
* `add Read Harry Potter`
* `add meet Jim \\at Holland Village`

Format : `add <task name> at/from <Start Time>`

Examples:
* `add Homework at 2pm` 

	This add a task to 2pm of the current day
	
* `add project meeting at 21/11/16`

	This gives it the current time when you add the task
	
* `add tutorial at `7pm 12/12/16`
* `add buy gift at 3 days later`
* `add buy presents at christmas`

##### Adding a deadline task
Adds a task with only the end time <br>
Format : `add <task name> by/to <End Time>`

Examples:
* `add Homework by 2pm` 
	
	This add a task to 2pm of the current day
	
* `add project meeting at 21/11/16` 
	
	This gives it the current time when you add the task

* Pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>SPACEBAR</kbd> after typing `a` would autocomplete it to `add`
* Pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>SPACEBAR</kbd> after typing `d` wont do anything as both `done` and `delete` start with `d`
* Pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>SPACEBAR</kbd> after typing `de` would autocomplete it to `delete
