### Model implementation

The model component model the data of the application.

#### The `ModelManager` class

The `ModelManager` class implements the `Model` interface, and provides access to data in model while hiding the internal complexity of its various classes. All external components can only interact with the model data via this class.

#### The `TaskManager` class

The `TaskManager` class stores the list of `UniqueTaskList`. It is an internal class of the Model component. The external component can only access its data through the `ReadOnlyTaskManager` or `Model` interface.

#### The `ReadOnlyTaskManager` class

The `ReadOnlyTaskManager` interface provides a read-only view to the `TaskManager` object.

#### The `Config` class

The `Config` class stores the configuration settings.

### Storage implementation

The storage component uses [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) to
serialize/deserialize model data to/from JSON files.

#### The Storage interfaces

The storage package defines two storage interfaces, `UserPrefsStorage` and
`TaskManagerStorage`. These interfaces contain methods for saving/loading `ReadOnlyTaskManager`.

The storage package also defines a facade `Storage` interface, which combines
together the aforementioned `UserPrefsStorage` and `TaskManagerStorage` interfaces
into a single interface.
