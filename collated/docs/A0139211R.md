### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/forgetmenot/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/forgetmenot/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

## Frequently asked questions 
Q: How many times am I able to undo a previous command? <br>
A: You are able to undo any number of times up till the state where you first opened ForgetMeNot!

Q: I can't undo my previous commands after reopening ForgetMeNot <br>
A: Like most task managers out there, ForgetMeNot does not support data backup while the program is not active

Q: Is it possible to set my storage path to a portable drive as I want to use them on different computers? <br>
A: Yes! Just use the setstorage command and choose the specified path of the portable drive

Q: How do I edit recurring tasks? Do all of them change if I edit one single instance? <br>
A: No, only the selected instance gets edited. Our design philosophy is that recurring tasks should be treated as 
   separate instances so that the other recurring tasks would not be affected if you were to make changes to one of 
   them due to some circumstances.
