The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `undo`.

<img src="images\SDforUndo.png" width="800"><br>

When `undo` is entered by the user, the method loadFromHistory() will be executed to replace the current `TaskManager` to the most recent `TaskManager` saved in `Model` when saveToHistory() was previously executed. When the user exits ForgetMeNot, this stored history will be cleared.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/forgetmenot/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save ForgeMeNot's data in xml format and read it back.
* can redirect the storage file path for the data in xml format and read it back.

**Measuring Coverage Locally using EclEmma**:
 * Install the [EclEmma Eclipse Plugin](http://www.eclemma.org/) in your computer and use that to
   find code that is not covered by the tests.
 * To measure coverage after installing plugin, right-clck on the `src/test/java` folder and choose 
   `Coverage As` > `JUnit Test`.
 * To see the color code for EclEmma coverage. Refer to [this](http://www.eclemma.org/userdoc/
   annotations.html).
